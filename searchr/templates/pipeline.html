<h3>Analysis Pipeline</h3>
<br>
<p>Our analysis pipeline showcases its ability to query >800,000 DNA methylation sites that have passed stringent
    quality control and visualises the resulting data in an intuitive way.

    We have utilised the Illumina Epic array to provide comprehensive coverage of DNA methylation within the human
    brain. The Illumina Epic array enables quantitative investigation of selected methylation sites across the human
    genome. Methylation data provides an opportunity to investigate hyper- and hypomethylation which not only impact
    gene expression but have further implications in biological processes and diseases.

    Our workflow begins with collating prefrontal cortex samples from the human brain. In total, 136 samples were
    collated and run on the Epic array. During quality control and normalisation 45 samples were removed as a results of
    failed samples, duplicate samples, cerebellum samples and child samples. Due to a sparsity of samples beyond 23
    weeks, we reduced our samples to only those between 6 â€“ 23 weeks post conception resulting in 91 samples to be
    carried forward into the data analysis workflow.
